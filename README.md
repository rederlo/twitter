Twitter app oauth

This is a basic Django APP which does the below stuff

         Create a login button in the home page
·        A user should be authenticated using Twitter API (oAuth) - you can use any twitter python libs
·        After a successful login (using Twitter API) print the users name in a new page. This page should also have a textbox and a submit button.
·        When the user posts a message to Twitter API, it should add a new Tweet as the logged in user.
·        After a tweet is added, you need to be able to verify that the new tweet was indeed added by listing the user’s last 10 tweets.
